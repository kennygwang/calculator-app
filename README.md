Calculator App
==============

This web calculator can subtract, multiply, divide, square root, and clear result.
It has interchangeable light / dark designs and was made entirely in native, vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery!).
Input is exclusively via the clickable buttons of the calculator.

Lastly, my calculator does exhibit the errors in floating point arithmetic that 
are a byproduct of the IEEE-754 standard.
